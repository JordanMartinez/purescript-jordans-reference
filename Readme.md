# Purescript-Jordans-Reference

This repo is my way of using the [Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230) to learn Purescript and its ecosystem.

All code uses PureScript `0.13.8`

## Table of Contents

[**Table of Contents (Detailed)**](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference/blob/latestRelease/table-of-contents.md)

Below is a concise ToC that shows the kind of questions each folder answers:
- **00-Getting-Started**: Why learn/use PureScript? How do I set up an editor (using Atom)? How do I use the REPL? What other things should I know before starting my learning journey?
- **01-Philosophical Foundations**: What are some foundational ideas I need to understand before FP makes more sense? What is the "big idea" behind using FP languages? What are the drawbacks of using FP languages?
- **02-Build-Tools**: Which tools do I use to compile, build, and deploy my libraries/applications, and how do I use them? What does a typical project workflow look like? What other tools help me be more productive?
- **11-Syntax**: Purescript's syntax explained using the very clear examples that are verified by the compiler. How do I read/write type-level programming? What other compiler features exist syntactically?
- **21-Hello-World**: How do I use FP techniques to write a refactorable, testable, readable program? How do I debug FP programs?
- **22-Projects**: What are some real-world beginner-friendly examples of FP programs? How do I use a given library?
    - Random Number Game - a game that runs on the console and in the browser using the same "business logic"
    - Table of Contents Generator - a program that generates a table of contents for a GitHub repository.
- **31-Design Patterns**: (WIP) What are commonly-used patterns to solve problems in FP languages?
- **41-Ecosystem**: - (WIP) What is broad overview of the libraries in Purescript (categorized by tags)?

## Guidelines for this project

### Contributing

Feel free to open a new issue for:
- Clarification on something you don't understand. If I don't know it yet and I'm interested, it'll force me to learn it
- A link to something you'd like me to research more. If I'm interested or see the value, I'll look into it and try to document it or explain the idea in a clear way
- Corrections for any mistakes I've made
- Improvements to anything I've written thus far

### Learning Purescript Using This Project

- Git clone this repo
- Use these rules to read through the folders' contents in the correct order:
    - **Read a folder's "ReadMe.md" file first (if it exists).** It may provide additional info for how to read a folder's contents.
    - **Read a folder's files or subfolders in numerical order.** For example, read things in the order they appear below:
        - 00-Getting-Started/ReadMe.md
        - 00-Getting-Started/01-Install-Guide.md
        - 00-Getting-Started/... (the rest of the folder's contents)
        - 01-Build-Tools/... (the folder's contents)
        - 11-Syntax/ReadMe.md
        - 11-Syntax/01-Basic-Syntax/src/00-Comments-and-Documentation.purs
        - 11-Syntax/01-Basic-Syntax/src/01-Preliminary-Concepts/01-Value-Function-Data-Syntax.purs
        - 11-Syntax/01-Basic-Syntax/src/01-Preliminary-Concepts/02-Explainng-Kinds.md
        - 11-Syntax/01-Basic-Syntax/src/01-Preliminary-Concepts/03-The-Prim-Module.purs
        - 11-Syntax/01-Basic-Syntax/src/02-Data-and-Functions/... (the rest of the folder's content)
- Compile the code where possible, either before or after you experiment

## Naming Conventions Used In This Repo

### Numbering System

When you see this number system:
```
01-File-Name.md
02-Folder-Name/
03-File-Name2.md
11-File-Name.md
```
You should understand it like so:
```
[major theme/idea][minor concept/point]
```
Each major theme will almost always have 1..9 minor concepts/points. Thus, you will sometimes not see a `10-file-name.md` file:
```
09-first-major-theme--file-9.md
-- 10-file-name is intentionally missing here
11-second-major-theme--file-1.md
```

In situations, where 9 files were not enough, I converted a file into a folder and each file in that folder further explains it.

### An 'x' in a File/Folder Name

If a file or folder name has `x` in the numerical part of its name (e.g. `0x-File-or-Folder-Name`, `9x-File-or-Folder-Name`), it means I am still deciding where it should appear in the numerical order (and it is likely still a work in progress).

### Referring to Files/Folders in this repo

Lastly, when referring to folders/files, we'll omit the numerical ordering (since the final order is still being determined). So, rather than `00-Getting-Started`, you'll see `Getting Started` folder. Rather than `00-Getting-Started/01-Install-Guide.md`, you'll see `Getting-Started/Install-Guide.md`

## Versioning Policy

See this section to help you understand what a new release means

### Principles

- **Provide "stable" versions...**:
    - Readers of a given version should be able to read and bookmark files without worrying about those files/links breaking due to changes in its name (via renaming/reordering files, headers in files, etc.)
    - Older versions should be available via `git tag`.
- **...without restricting developer creativity**:
    - I should be able to continue writing new content and re-ordering things without concern
- **Load the latest release:**
    - This repo should show the latest release version of this project, not the one on which I'm working. In other words, the default branch should coincide with the last release.
- **Lessen maintenance as much as possible:**
    - There should only be two branches, `latestRelease` and `development` since a branch name like `master` is overloaded with connotations. Those who want to read older versions can checkout a tag.
    - I currently will not hyperlink to other files within this project until either a `1.0.0` release is made or I find a way to automate that.
- **Indicate PS version:**
    - As Purescript continues to evolve, the release should use a prefix indicating which major PS version for which this library is up-to-date.

### Release Syntax and Explanation

`ps-[purescript's major release]-v[Major].[Minor].[Patch]` where
- purescript's major release means
    - Normally, this would be `1.x.x`, but we don't yet have a `1.0` release yet. Thus, it is currently `0.12.x`
    - `x` is a placeholder for the latest minor/patch release.
- major change means
    - a file/folder name has changed, so that bookmarks or links to that file/folder are now broken
    - files/folders have been modified, so that one is recommended to re-read the modified parts
    - Spago was updated to a breaking change release
- minor change means
    - a file's contents have been modified/updated to such a degree that one is recommended to re-read the modified parts- Read through these links about learning:
    - a file's header name has changed, so that bookmarks or links to that header/section are now broken
    - Spago was updated to a minor release
- patch means
    - additional files/folders have been added without breaking links
    - a file's contents have been modified/updated to a minor degree that one could re-read the modified parts but is not likely to benefit much from it.
    - a file's contents have been slightly updated (typos, markdown rendering issues, etc.)
