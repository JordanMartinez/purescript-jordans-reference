# Purescript: Jordan's Reference

This repo is my way of using the [Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230) to learn Purescript and its ecosystem.

All code uses PureScript `0.13.8`

To learn PureScript using this project:
1. Git clone this repo
2. [Bookmark and read through this repo online](https://jordanmartinez.github.io/purescript-jordans-reference-site/)
3. Compile the code locally where possible, follow along, and experiment

## Guidelines for this project

### Contributing

Feel free to open a new issue for:
- Clarification on something you don't understand. If I don't know it yet and I'm interested, it'll force me to learn it
- A link to something you'd like me to research more. If I'm interested or see the value, I'll look into it and try to document it or explain the idea in a clear way
- Corrections for any mistakes I've made
- Improvements to anything I've written thus far

## Naming Conventions Used In This Repo

### Numbering System

When you see this number system:
```
01-File-Name.md
02-Folder-Name/
03-File-Name2.md
11-File-Name.md
```
You should understand it like so:
```
[major theme/idea][minor concept/point]
```
Each major theme will almost always have 1..9 minor concepts/points. Thus, you will sometimes not see a `10-file-name.md` file:
```
09-first-major-theme--file-9.md
-- 10-file-name is intentionally missing here
11-second-major-theme--file-1.md
```

In situations, where 9 files were not enough, I converted a file into a folder and each file in that folder further explains it.

### An 'x' in a File/Folder Name

If a file or folder name has `x` in the numerical part of its name (e.g. `0x-File-or-Folder-Name`, `9x-File-or-Folder-Name`), it means I am still deciding where it should appear in the numerical order (and it is likely still a work in progress).
