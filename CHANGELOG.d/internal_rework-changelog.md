* Begin using [purs-changelog](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-up-changelog) to manage changelog entries.

  Previous changelogs were moved into the `old-changelogs` directory.
  The previous generated changelogs weren't as useful/readable as just
  keeping a manual log. I also think this will be easier to track what
  changed as I can add/edit an entry as I make the change itself.
