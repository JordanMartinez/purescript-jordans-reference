* Split example CI files into own files; add spago next/legacy

  Previously, the `Continuous-Integration.md` file stored
  sample CI files for GitHub Actions in a code block.

  These weren't easy to copy-and-paste, so I've moved them
  into their own files with a Readme file explaining them.

  I also distinguish between Spago Legacy (Haskell-version)
  from Spago Next (PureScript version)
