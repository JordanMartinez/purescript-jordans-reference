This folder is still a work-in-progress!

Scott Wlaschin, a FP expert warns that [Functional Design patterns](https://www.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/functional-design-patterns-devternity2018) are very different from Object Oriented patterns (the F# examples are easy to translate into PureScript).

See [the related issues](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ADesign-Patterns) regarding this folder for a more up-to-date understanding.
