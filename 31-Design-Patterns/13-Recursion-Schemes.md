# Recursion Schemes

See [Edward Kmett's "Recursion Schemes: A Field Guide"](http://comonad.com/reader/2009/recursion-schemes/) for a more-readable definition of the "xxx-morphism" terminology (e.g. hylomorphism).

See [Introduction to Recursion Schemes](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/an-introduction-to-recursion-schemes/), a 4-part series that very clearly explains how they work and what they are. Papers referenced are below:
- [Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire](https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/functional-programming-with-bananas-lenses-envelopes-and-barbed-w)
- [Primitive (Co)Recursion and Course-of-Value(Co)Iteration, Categorically](http://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/papers/inf99.pdf)

See [Recursion Scheme Cookbook](https://github.com/vil1/recursion-schemes-cookbook), a documentation project that helps explain SlamData's [Matyroshka (purescript)](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-matryoshka) library.
