# Parsing

This file will store various links related to parsing.

For a good introduction to parsing text via parser combinators, the approach used in FP instead of regular expressions, see [Monadic Parsing at the input boundary](https://hasgeek.com/FP-Juspay/pureconf/schedule/monadic-parsers-at-the-input-boundary-W7Hvh68RGtuyZQ7qttTq4z).

## Left Recursion Problem

See https://github.com/glebec/left-recursion for a clear explanation of this problem and its solution
