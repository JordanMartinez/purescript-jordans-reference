# RowList

The final aspect of type-level programming to learn is [`RowList`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/builtins/docs/Prim.RowList). This is where type-level programming often gets interesting because one can do interesting things with records at the type-level.

It is not covered in this folder. Rather, it is covered in `Hello World/Type Level Programming/src/RowList` because one needs to understand how [`Data.Foldable.foldl`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-foldable-traversable/5.0.1/docs/Data.Foldable#v:foldl) works (which is explained in `Hello World/Collections and Loops`). Until one understands what a "fold left" is, understanding `RowList` will not make much sense either.
