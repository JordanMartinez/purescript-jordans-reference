{-
The last data type keyword to explain here is `newtype`.

It is a compile-time-only type that only takes one type as its argument.

These are useful primarily for two reasons
  - They add a more meaningful name to another type (like type aliases).
  - They are compile-time-only types, so one does not incur runtime overhead
      (like type aliases).
  - They need to be constructed/deconstructed in code (unlike type aliases).
      When used with Phantom Types (see the `Design Patterns` folder), they can
      restrict how developers can use the type in very useful ways.
  - They enable one to define multiple type class instances for the same type.

-- Syntax:
newtype NewTypeName = OnlyAllowsOneConstructor WhichOnlyTakesOneArgument_TheWrappedType

-- Given the following code:
data Box a = Box a

class Show_ a where
  show_ :: a -> String

instance showBox :: (Show a) => Show (Box a) where
  show (Box a) = "Box(" <> show a <> ")"

-- What if we wanted to use a different type class instance for `Box` in some
-- situations, but not want to redefine `Box` as a new type with a different
-- name? We would do this:
newtype Box2 a = Box2 (Box a)

instance showBox2 :: (Show a) => Show (Box2 (Box a)) where
  show (Box2 (Box a)) = "Box with value of [" <> show a <> "] inside of it."

-- Or, to add more context to a type...
newtype Name = Name String
newtype Age = Age Int
newtype Relationships = Relationships (List People)

-- Assuming all three above have a Show instance:
--
-- printPerson :: Name -> Age -> Relationships -> String
-- printPerson (Name n) (Age i) (Relationships l) =
--    "Name: " <> n <> ", Age: " <> show i <> ", Relationships: " <> show l

-- Similar to `data` and `type`, newtypes can also have a kind signature:

-- Implicit kind signature: Type -> Type
newtype SomeValue a = SomeValue (Box a)

newtype SomeValue_ExplicitKindSignature :: Type -> Type
newtype SomeValue_ExplicitKindSignature a = SomeValueExplicit (Box a)

-- needed to compile

type WhichOnlyTakesOneArgument_TheWrappedType = String

data List :: Type -> Type
data List a

data People
