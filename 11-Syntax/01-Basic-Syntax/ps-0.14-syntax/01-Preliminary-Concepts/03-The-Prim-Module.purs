module Syntax.Basic.PrimitiveTypesAndKinds where

import Prelude

{-
The following file documents the Prim module. This module is imported
by default into every PureScript file (unless one hides it using Module aliases,
which are described in the Module Syntax folder) and is embedded in the
compiler itself to provide value literals for certain types and syntax sugar.

See the full documenation here:
https://pursuit.purescript.org/builtins/docs/Prim

This file will document all the types whose kind signature is `Type`.
Their kind signatures aren't that important at this level in your understanding.

Note: To prevent conflicts between the real code and this compileable file,
we're appending underscores to the types. Remove the underscore to get the
real thing in Purescript.

In other words
Purescript:        DataType  :: Kind
This example: data DataType_ -- Kind
-}
data Number_ -- Type -- double-precision float number

exampleNumber :: Number
exampleNumber = 1.0

data Int_ -- Type

exampleInt1 :: Int
exampleInt1 = 1

exampleInt2 :: Int
exampleInt2 = 0x01 -- alternative way to write them

exampleInt3 :: Int
exampleInt3 = 1_000_000 -- use underscores for thousands character

data Boolean_ -- Type

exampleTrue :: Boolean
exampleTrue = true

exampleFalse :: Boolean
exampleFalse = false
{-
Note: The Boolean data type is used via true/false literal values instead of
True/False constructors as one might expect, especially those coming from Haskell
where such a simple data type would be defined as:

data Boolean = True | False

In Purescript, having Javascript as the main compilation target, the decision was
made to use true/false literal values for the Boolean data type instead of
having it be defined as a simple Algebric Data Type (ADT) as is the case in Haskell.
