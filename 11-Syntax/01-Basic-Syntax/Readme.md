# Basic Syntax

Read through these files in their order. To further grasp the concept, write your own version of the code and see if it still compiles by running:
```bash
spago build
```

To see what the documentation looks like, run this command:
```bash
spago docs --open
```
The above command will generate the docs, and then open the file, `./generated-docs/index.html`.
