Read through these files in their order. To further grasp the concept, write your own version of the code and see if it still compiles by running:
```bash
spago build
```

To see what the documentation looks like, run this command:
```bash
spago docs
```
Then, open the file, `./generated-docs/index.html`, and open a module to see what it outputs.
