Previously, we saw that `show` could be used "implicitly" when we
knew what the type was and "explicitly" when we did not know what
the type was but knew it had a constraint

In both cases, the compiler automatically figures out how which instance's
implementation to use. But how does it do this? How do Type Classes work?

Dictionaries are what enable a function/value to magically appear in the
implementation of a function's body. The below code is a summary of
this article about type class 'dictionaries':

I could not explain it clearer nor more concisely than they did.
