{-
We saw previously that we can define functions inside a `let` binding
and use it later after the `in`. The below example does NOT have a type
signature annotating it.                                                      -}
letBindingExample :: Int
letBindingExample =
  let
    add4 x = x + 4
  in add4 6 -- outputs 10

{-
We also saw that we can add type signatures to the `let` binding
to make it easier to read:                                                    -}
letBindingExampleWithTypeSignature :: Int
letBindingExampleWithTypeSignature =
  let
    add4 :: Int -> Int
    add4 x = x + 4
  in add4 6

{-
All of the above examples use monomorphism (i.e. each function only works
on 1 type / there IS NOT a "forall" anywhere), not polymorphism
(i.e. each function works on multiple types / there IS a "forall" somewhere).
In some situations, we may want to use polymorphism/"forall" in our
`let` bindings:                                                             -}
letBindingWithPolymorphicTypeSignature :: Int
letBindingWithPolymorphicTypeSignature =
  let
    ignoreArgumentAndReturn4 :: forall a. a -> Int
    ignoreArgumentAndReturn4 _ = 4
  in
    (ignoreArgumentAndReturn4 8) + (ignoreArgumentAndReturn4 "foo")

{-
In the above example, when you remove the type signature above the let binding,
you will discover that "`let` bindings lack generalization". The below example
will not compile. You can uncomment it and see for yourself:                  -}
-- failsToCompile :: Int
-- failsToCompile =
--   let
--     -- based on the usage below, it would appear that this function's
--     -- type signature is "forall a. a -> Int"
--     polymorphicLetBindingWithNoTypeSignature _ = 4
--   in
--     (polymorphicLetBindingWithNoTypeSignature 8) +   -- argument is Int
--     (polymorphicLetBindingWithNoTypeSignature "foo") -- argument is String

{-
Running `failsToCompile` will produce the following error:

  Error found:

{-
When the compiler comes across the first usage of
`polymorphicLetBindingWithNoTypeSignature`, the type of the first argument, 8,
is Int. Rather than making this binding polymorphic, the compiler assumes
that the function is monomorphic and its type signature will be
"Int -> Int". Thus, when it encounters the second usage of the function,
`polymorphicLetBindingWithNoTypeSignature "foo"`, it fails because
`String` is not the same type as `Int`.

This missing feature is called "`let` generalization." Its absence is
intentional. For more context, see the paper titled,
"Let should not be generalized"
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tldi10-vytiniotis.pdf
-}

{-
Since the `where` clause is syntax sugar for `let` bindings, this issue can
also arise when you use bindings in the `where` clauses that are polymorphic
and do not have a type signature.
