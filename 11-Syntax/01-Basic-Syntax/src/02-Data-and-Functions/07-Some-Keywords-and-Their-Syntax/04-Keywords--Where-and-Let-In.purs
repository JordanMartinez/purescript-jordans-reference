{-
The 'where' keyword enables us to break large functions
  down into smaller functions (or values) that compose.
Differences from the `let-in` syntax:
- functions/values are defined after the main function -}

whereFunction1 arg1 arg2 =

  -- functions defined below the 'where' keyword can be used in the main
  -- function and any other made-up functions defined in this block

  -- Note: If 'whereFunction1' had used 'forall' syntax above to specify
  -- generic types, we would not need to respecify them in any made-up functions
  -- that appear in this where block. However, since we want `returnFour` to work
  -- for multiple types, we'll need to specify that here.

{-
The 'let...in' syntax does the same thing as 'where' but it defines things
  before they get used in an expression: -}
letInFunction1 :: String -> String
letInFunction1 expression =
  let
    binding = expression
  in
    somethingThatUses binding -- wherever `binding` is used, we mean `expression`

letInFunction2 :: String -> String -> String
letInFunction2 expression1 expression2 =
  let
    binding1 = expression1
    binding2 = expression2
  in
    somethingThatUses (binding1 <> binding2)

-- One can also define functions
letInFunction3 :: String -> String
letInFunction3 value =
  let
    function "firstMatch"  = bodyOfPatternMatch
    function "secondMatch" = bodyOfPatternMatch
    function catchAll      = bodyOfPatternMatch
  in
    function value

-- One can also use guards with let
letWithGuards :: Int -> String
letWithGuards x =
  let result
        | x == 0 = "zero"
        | x == 1 = "one"
        | otherwise = "something else"
  in computeSomethingWithString result

WARNING!

The 'where' clause cannot be used with pattern matching due to a bug
in the Purescript langauge
GitHub Issue: https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/888

This will not compile:

patternMatchGuardWithWhere x | x == 0 = stringValue
                             | otherwise = "other value"

  stringValue :: String
  stringValue = "string value"

somethingThatUses :: String -> String
