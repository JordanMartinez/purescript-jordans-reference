Sometimes, using an abbreviated function / eta-reducing will cause problems.
See this issue for more details:
https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/950

To fix it, eta-expand the function (i.e. include the argument):
-- change this:
f :: Int -> String
f = show

-- to
f :: Int -> String
f x = show x
