# Designing Type Classes

Why does PureScript disallow Orphan Instances while other languages (e.g. Haskell) allow them? Scala has type classes, but they don't function like PureScript's type classes.

If you are curious to learn more, read [Type classes, class coherence and dependent types](https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/pny1-assignment/blob/master/DepTC.md), which provides insight into the design and implementations of the 'type class' concept as well as implementations' tradeoffs.
