# Prelude Syntax

This folder documents the syntax that is enabled by importing [Prelude](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/).

Ignore this folder's contents until you are reading through the `Prelude` folder in the `Hello World` folder. When you are in that folder and you see unfamiliar syntax, you should probably return here:
- do notation
- ado notation
- Natural Transformations
