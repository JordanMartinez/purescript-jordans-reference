# Old Changelogs

When this work was initially created, I kept a manual changelog as I wrote/edited things: [old-changelog.md](./old-CHANGELOG.md). I then changed to using an automated one via [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). I then switched back to a manual one as the repo was largely stable by this point.
