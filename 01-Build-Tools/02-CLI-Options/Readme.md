# CLI Options

It's easier to read through the CLI's documentation by reading them in a mind-map format rather than a man-page-like doc. The following libraries have been documented:
- purs: `0.12.0`
- pulp: `12.3.0`
- psc-package: `0.3.2`

Download [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) to read through the documenation in a mind-map format

Otherwise, read through the SVG file:
