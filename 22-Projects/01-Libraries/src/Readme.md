# Libraries

**Note:** This folder is deprecated. The below guides are being moved to their respective repo. Once migrated, this folder will be removed entirely.

These are my overview of the libraries used throughout ALL of the projects I write in the `Projects` folder.

Look at each specific project folder (e.g. "Random Number") and see which libraries you need to learn and become familiar with before looking at that project's code.

Here's how to understand the numerical ordering here:
- `0x` - files/folders in here are self-contained. You don't need to look at other folders/files before it will make sense.
- `1x` - files/folders in here are NOT self-contained. You might not fully understand the example until you have looked at the dependencies it uses.
