# Projects

This folder's purposes are
- to solidify one's understanding for how to write FP programs according to modern FP architecture principles.
    - Explain the throught-process behind designing some program by starting with the properties one wants to employ. This will include diagrams and other explanations.
    - Compare the various ways one can structure an FP program and analyze their pros/cons and other tradeoffs. The following approaches are covered here:
        - ReaderT approach (all folders)
        - Run approach (all folders)
        - other approaches (only in the `Random Number Game` folder).
    - Explain and show how to test and benchmark our code
- to introduce the reader to a few commonly-used libraries in the "real world."
    - We'll introduce/overview the libraries we'll use in later projects before using them in those projects.
- to help the reader determine which approach with which they feel most comfortable (there is no "the one and only way" to doing this)

Note: each 'project' folder in the `src` folder has a corresponding folder in the `test` and `benchmark` folders. When reading through a project's files, read through its `src` folder's content before its `test` folder's content, followed by its `benchmark` folder's content.

## Clarifying Our Terminology

When overviewing the design process of the program, we'll use the following terminology to refer to the various layers of our program:

| Layer Level | Onion Architecture Term | General idea |
| - | - | - |
| Layer 4 | Core | Strong types with well-defined properties and their pure, total functions that operate on them
| Layer 3 | Domain | the "business logic" code which uses effects
| Layer 2 | API | the "production" or "test" monad which "links" these effects/capabilties to their implementations: <ul><li>a newtyped `ReaderT` and its instances</li><li>the `Free`/`Run` monad's language and its interpretation</li></ul>
| Layer 1 | Infrastructure | the platform-specific framework/libraries we'll use to implement some special effects/capabilities (i.e. `Node.ReadLine`/`Halogen`/`StateT`)
| Layer 0 | Main<br>(no equivalent onion term) | the program's entry point<br>the "base" monad that runs the program (e.g. production: `Effect`/`Aff`; test: `Identity`)

## Libraries Overviewed

Below is the current list of libraries we introduce and further explain here. This list may grow over time.
- `Node.ReadLine` for console-based programs (`purescript-node-readline`)
- `Halogen` for web-based programs (`purescript-halogen`)
- `Aff` for using asynchronous effects (`purescript-aff`)
- `Yargs` for command-line parsing (`purescript-yargs`)
- `Node.FS` for reading/writing files (`purescript-node-fs-aff`)
- `StringParers` for parsing files' contents (`purescript-string-parsers`)
- `Tree` for producing trees (`purescript-tree`)

## Projects

- (Easy) "Guess the Random Number" game.
- (Easy-ish) "Table of Contents Generator" program for this specific repository.

## Why Halogen and Not React?

I'll quote Thomas Honeyman in full below:

> Halogen differs from Elm in that it supports components with local state and can also use a global state across components. (I'm aware you can also implement the Elm architecture in Halogen, but I haven't tried this myself.)
>
> At CitizenNet I worked on a Halogen app, and at Awake Security I work on a PureScript React app. In both cases, components helped ensure that state is kept where you actually reason about it and use it to produce UI, and that global state is kept uncluttered and minimal. I want to store things like the current user in global state, and I want to store things like which tab is focused in the panel in the sidebar in the component that actually cares about it.
>
> This isn't an argument for Halogen; it's an argument for components with local state. I would personally choose PureScript React / Halogen over TEA done in PureScript for this reason. That said, if this doesn't really matter to you, there's no reason not to use Spork, Hedwig, Concur, etc.
>
> Between Halogen and React the main decision, for me, is whether I want to interop with the React ecosystem or not. Using React under the hood can mean some surprising quirks and workarounds (for example: to deal with React's widespread use of referential equality), but the experience overall is pleasant, and at least I know if I need a charting library I can pull one off the shelf from React in a way that's not always true in Halogen.
>
> So why Halogen? Halogen lets me use components, or skip them if I don't want them. It's 100% PureScript (with the [virtual dom library](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen-vdom) implemented in PureScript). The effect monad, HalogenM, has a really nice story for async code, forking threads in components, etc. You can freely intersperse your own type classes in code written in your components. And with [halogen-hooks](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-hooks) there's a nice way to write functions that use local state and reuse that stateful logic across many components.
>
> I just don't see anywhere near the same flexibility + ability to reason about your code using other frameworks. I subjectively feel that when I write code in Halogen I get to push PureScript as far as it can go in a way that's not true with say PS-React or Elm clones. Unfortunately, that does carry an up-front cost in learning Halogen.
>
> As a caveat: I don't have much experience with Elm or the Elm Architecture, so please feel free to correct me if I have made a mistaken assumption. I have written a small app using Elm, but as the state grew larger and it became tedious doing deep updates I moved to PureScript. However, I don't know how folks writing large Elm applications handle this problem and how satisfying the solutions are.

## Compilation Instructions

### Setting Up This Folder

Since this folder includes bindings to JS libraries, we need to install them via NPM before their purescript bindings will work. Follow these instructions:

1. Install the NPM dependencies locally

```bash
# Benchmark.js - https://benchmarkjs.com/
npm install benchmark
```

2. Build the folder's contents using `spago`, which will also install the PS libraries
```bash
spago build
```

### Building/Running Each Approach

Each folder will specify the `spago` command to run to build/run the program. Because of the multi-project nature of this folder, the `spago` command must be executed in `Hello World/Projects/`, not in each project's folder.
To run a web-based program, follow the folder's build instructions and then open the `dist/<project-name>/<FP structure approach>/index.html` file
