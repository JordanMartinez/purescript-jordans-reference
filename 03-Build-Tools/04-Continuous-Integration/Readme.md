# Continuous Integration

This folder contains copy-and-paste-able files that can be used to setup CI using GitHub Actions. Each file works for a different build tool:

- Bower
- Spago (Legacy) - the original `spago` that was written using Haskell
- Spago (Next) - the upcoming `spago` that was written using PureScript
