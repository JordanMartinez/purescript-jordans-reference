# Build Tools

This folder accomplishes the following:

- Explain the various tools used throughout the ecosystem and their usages/differences:
    - Document the differences between `Bower` and `Spago` dependency managers
    - Document the difference between `Pulp` and `Spago` build tools
- Document the CLI options for the most popular tools (e.g. purs, pulp, spago, etc.)
- Document a typical workflow from project start to finish (creation, fast-feedback development, initial publishing, 'bump' publishing)

## History: How We Got Here

The following explanation does not cover all the tools used in PureScript's ecosystem. However it provides context for later files. In short, `spago` is both the official dependency manager and build tool. `bower` can be thought of as a deprecated dependency manager; the community is in the process of building a registry that will replace the Bower registry since it no longer accepts uploads. `pulp` is a build tool that uses `bower`; its usage will become more common again once the registry is built.

### Phase 1: Initial Tooling

PureScript's compiler was originally called `psc` (<strong>P</strong>ure<strong>S</strong>cript <strong>C</strong>ompiler) before later being renamed to `purs`. (We'll see this `psc` name reappear elsewhere in a related project).

PureScript did not use `npm` as a dependency manager because of an issue related to transitive dependencies. Thus, they used `bower` because it fit their goals/requirements better. (All of this is covered more in the `Dependency Managers/Bower Explained.md` file).

Bodil Stokke (with later contributions from Harry Garrood) later wrote a tool called `pulp` that worked with `bower` and `purs` to provide a user-friendly developer workflow:
- download your dependencies
- compile, build, and test your project
- publish libraries and their docs
- easily bump the project's version

### Phase 2: The `psc-package` Experiment

`Bower` worked fine, but there were a few user-interface issues that made it difficult to use, especially when a new PureScript release was made that included breaking changes.

As a result, `psc-package` was developed as an experimental dependency manager. It solved some of the problems that `bower` faced. `pulp` later supported `psc-package`, so that one could benefit from the simple developer workflow.

However, `psc-package` encountered its own problems, too. People could not easily create and modify something called a "local package set" (a term that is explained later in the `Spago-Explained.md` file).

To resolve these problems, Justin Woo started a project called `spacchetti` (he likes to name his projects via food puns), which made it much easier to create and modify a "local package set."

See the below image to visualize this:

### Phase 3: Improving the `psc-package` Developer Workflow via `Spago`

From the above image, one should infer that using `pulp` and `bower` was overall easier to use and explain. Thus, Justin Woo and Fabrizo Ferrai started a project called `spago`. `spago` evolved out of `spacchetti` and reimplemented parts of `psc-package` into one program with a seamless developer workflow. While `psc-package` can still be used, it's better to use `spago`.

The below image summarizes the current state:

### Phase 4: `Spago` becomes mainstream while `psc-package` is less used

Spago dropped support for `psc-package` commands in the `v0.11.0` release. `psc-package` is still usable and is more or less feature-complete. However, no further work on it will be done. Rather, Spago has become the main dependency manager when utilizing package-sets.

The community is now split between `pulp` + `bower` workflows and `spago` workflows. One must still use `pulp` + `bower` if they want to do the following:
- publish their library's docs to Pursuit
- include their library in a package set, so `spago` users can use it

### Phase 5: The need for a PureScript registry (Bower registry no longer accepts new uploads)

The Bower registry stopped accepting new uploads. The community quickly updated their tooling to workaround how libraries are published and installed. However, it was clear that PureScript now needed to create a registry.

Fabrizio Ferrai led the effort to build this registry with significant input from Harry Garrood. The registry is not yet complete, so the community is in this in-between stage.

Regardless, the following is still true:
- most people are now using `spago`
- the `pulp` + `bower` workflow is still needed to publish a library, but it works differently now.
    - See [these instructions for how to use `bower` to publish a library in this in-between context](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/up-to-date-instructions-for-publishing-new-packages/1953)
    - See the `Dependency Managers/Bower Explained` file for clarification on how to install packages as dependencies if one is using `bower`
- Thomas has written a [Recommended Tooling for PureScript Applications](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/recommended-tooling-for-purescript-applications-in-2019/948) post.

See [The `bower` registry is no longer accepting package submissions](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/the-bower-registry-is-no-longer-accepting-package-submissions/1103/) for more context.
