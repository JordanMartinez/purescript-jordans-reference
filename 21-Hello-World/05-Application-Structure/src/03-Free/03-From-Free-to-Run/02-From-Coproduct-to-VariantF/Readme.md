# From Coproduct to VariantF

Previously, we explained `Coproduct`
```purescript
data Either l r = Left l | Right r

newtype Coproduct f g a = Coproduct (Either (f a) (g a))

-- not nested
Either (Value e) (Add e)
Coproduct Value Add e

-- nested
Either   (Value e) (Either   (Add e) (Multiply e))
Coproduct Value    (Coproduct Add     Multiply) e

-- nested using convenience types from both libraries
Either3   (Value e) (Add e) (Multiply e)
Coproduct3 Value     Add     Multiply e
```

When covering `Either`, we explained that it was vulnerable to the following refactoring issues because it is not "open":
1. Change the order of the types
2. Add/Remove a type
3. Change one type to another type

Since `Coproduct` is just a newtype wrapper over an `Either`, it suffers from the same "closed" problem. Thus, we'll need a corresponding `Variant`-like type to make it open. That type is `VariantF`.

| | Open/Closed | Kind
| - | - | - |
| `Either` | Closed | Type
| `Variant` | Open | Type
| `Coproduct` | Closed | Type -> Type
| `VariantF` | Open | Type -> Type

## Explaining `VariantF`

[`VariantF`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-variant/5.0.0/docs/Data.Functor.Variant#t:VariantF) builds upon `Variant`. To refresh our memory, `Variant`...
- enables us to write nested `Either`s using row kinds via `# Type` that is refactor-proof due to row polymorphism (i.e. "open" data type).
- has two core methods:
    - `inj` (inject): puts a value into a `Variant`
    - `prj` (project): extracts a value from a `Variant` if it exists
- requires the use of `Symbol` and `SProxy` to specify which field within the row is being used

`VariantF` adds the additional requirement of using a proxy called `FProxy` to wrap a type-level higher-kinded type:
```purescript
data FProxy (f :: Type -> Type) = FProxy
```
Looking at `VariantF`, we see the following definition, whose type names I have modified to make it look similar to `Coproduct`:
```purescript
data    VariantF (f_and_g :: # Type) a

-- for example
--      VariantF (f :: FProxy F_Type, g :: FProxy G_Type) a
newtype Coproduct f g                a  = Coproduct (Either (f a) (g a))
```

Let's see what the code looks like now:
```purescript
-- Rather than writing this...
data Fruit_ConcreteType
  = Apple
  | Banana

-- Either Fruit_ConcreteType v
forall v. Variant  (fruit ::        Fruit_ConcreteType     | v)

-- ... we can now write this...
data Fruit_HigherKindedType e
  = Apple
  | Banana
derive instance f :: Functor Fruit_HigherKindedType

-- Either (Fruit_HigherKindedType Int) (v Int)
-- Coproduct Fruit_HigherKindedType v Int
forall v. VariantF (fruit :: FProxy Fruit_HigherKindedType | v) Int
```

## Composing Type-Level Types via `RowApply`

When we wanted to compose two or more data types, we used nested `Either`s. When we wanted to compose two or more higher-kinded data types, we used nested `Coproduct`s. What, then, do we write to compose two or more type-level higher-kinded types?

We use type aliases for rows and [`RowApply`/`+`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-typelevel-prelude/3.0.0/docs/Type.Row#t:RowApply) from `Prelude`:
```purescript
import Type.Row (type (+)) -- infix for RowApply
data ValueF e = ValueF Int
data AddF e = AddF e e

-- We create a type alias for a Row that includes
-- that specific higher-kinded type via FProxy
type Value r = (value :: FProxy Valuef | r)
type Add r = (add :: FProxy AddF | r)

-- and then compose the rows together using RowApply / "+"
type ValueAdd r = (Value + Add + r)
-- which desugars ultimately to
type ValueAdd otherRows = (value :: FProxy ValueF, add :: FProxy AddF | otherRows)

-- In our final type, we'll need to use an empty row to "close" the row
-- so that our code compiles
VariantF (ValueAdd + ()) e
```

## Defining Composable Algebras for Data Types

To evaluate an expression, we will write this:
```purescript
fold (
  case_
    -- valueAlgebra
    # on valueSymbol (\(ValueF x) -> x)                               {-
    # otherAlgebra -- like add or multiply                            -}
  ) expression
```
Thus, to make one `Algebra` (i.e. a fancy name for `f a -> a`) composable with other algebras of future data types that we might declare, we will write things like this:
```purescript
valueAlgebra :: forall r

             -- this is the `case_` function
              . (VariantF r Int -> Int)

             -> (VariantF (Value + r) Int -> Int)
valueAlgebra = on valueSymbol \(ValueF x) -> x
```

## Running an Algebra on an Expression

When we are ready to evaluate an expression, we will need the `algebra` (`f a -> a`) that can compute a value when given an expression, and the actual expression. To make it work for all output types, we'll use a generic type. Thus, we get something like this:
```purescript
run :: forall f a b output
      . Functor f
     -- |   composed algebra waiting for `case_`     |
     --  |     case_        | # | composed algebra |
     => ((VariantF () a -> b) -> f output -> output )
     -> Expression f
     -> output
run composedAlgebras expression = fold (case_ # composedAlgebras) expression
```
