# Implementing a Monad Transformer

This folder will show the thought process one would take to implement a monad transformer (e.g. the type class and its implementation) for manipulating state in a monad stack. The lessons learned/demonstrated in this folder will make it easier to understand the standard monad transformers covered in the rest of this `MTL` folder.
