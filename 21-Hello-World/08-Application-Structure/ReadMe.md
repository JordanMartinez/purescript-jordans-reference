# Application Structure

The upcoming folders will explain
- a small explanation on the onion architecture
- an overview of what MTL and Free/Run are and how they work conceptually
- how to structure an FP program via MTL and Free/Run, so that it looks like the onion architecture

These will later be used to write games/programs that run in Node via the console and in the Browser via Halogen

### A Word of Thanks

While trying to learn this myself, I benefited from looking at the code in stepchownfun's BSD-3 licensed project, [`effects`](https://github.com/stepchowfun/effects), as a guide when I did not completely understand something myself.
