# Collections and Loops

This folder will overview the `purescript-foldable-traversable` and `purescript-filterable` libraries. Together, these libraries provide most of the functions one would use when working with collections.

These two type classes are being overviewed because their concepts will arise later in the "Hello World" folder. Rather than explaining them there when we need them, we'll explain them here so that they are more familiar when we get to them there.
